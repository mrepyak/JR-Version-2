    <h1>As a problem solver, John has never met a problem he couldn’t solve. </h1>
    <br><p>John’s passion is tackling the high risk, costly issues, and driving them back to root cause. He then highlights the quality system gaps, carefully crafts C-level strategic plans, and works with plant champions’ input for global rollout.</p>
    <br><p>John enthusiastically joined Hans Premium Water’s top-notch executive team, whose philanthropic vision was to provide clean, pure water to the world. The company was to use revenues from systems sold, to fund units to the underdeveloped areas of the world with no access to clean, drinkable water.</p>
    <br><p>Within 6 months, John spearheaded a continuous improvement initiative to solve 90% of the quality issues on their Gen 1 Water Purifying System.</p>
    <br><p>Extensive team efforts were also underway on the Gen 2 model, preparing for a 2020 reveal. John boosted the executive team’s launch efforts with the careful introduction of only the most applicable and powerful APQP tools and methods. Unfortunately, due to covid-19, funding for Gen 2 evaporated, thus the global initiative was put on hold.</p>
    <br><p>Previously, John was Vice President of Quality Systems for Peterson Spring, a 100 year old, family owned automotive and commercial parts supplier. With the C-level team engaged, he forged a strategic action planning process, chartered a World Class problem solving system, and designed a new product launch process.</p>
    <br><p>During his tenure, John led the above initiatives to dramatically reduce the customer complaint rate from 3500 ppm to less than 1 ppm.</p>
    <br><p>John has lived a rich and diverse career in the aerospace, medical device, automotive, and electronics industries, with powerhouse companies like Rockwell International, Hexcel, Denso, Eaton, and Dana.</p>
    <br><p>He’s trained over 10,000 people in Six Sigma methods.</p>
    <br><p>Honda of America recognized John with a <b>LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD</b> for repeatedly producing winning problem-solving teams, based on his custom and highly effective methods of <a href="surefire.html">Root Cause Analysis</a>.</p>
    <br><p>John lives in Michigan, with his wife and youngest daughter. They are the proud parents of 5 children. His hobbies include working on and driving high performance track vehicles, restoring vintage muscle cars, golfing, coffee roasting, gardening, camping, fishing, and kayaking. With his wife, he also creates elaborate costumes, masks, puppets, and props for their daughter’s theater performances. </p>
